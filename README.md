#Workflow
1. Define Permissions
Permissions represent the smallest unit of access control. For example:

CREATE_USER: Ability to create new users.
VIEW_REPORTS: Access to view reports.
2. Create Roles
Roles are groups of permissions that represent a job function or responsibility. For instance:

Admin: Includes permissions to manage users, roles, and view activity logs.
Editor: Can modify content but has no access to user management.
Viewer: Read-only access to specific resources.
3. Assign Roles to Users
Users are assigned roles that grant them specific permissions. A user can have multiple roles, and their permissions are cumulative.

4. Access Control
When a user tries to perform an action, the system checks their assigned permissions:

If allowed, the action proceeds.
If denied, the user is shown an error or redirected.
5. Audit and Monitor
Administrators can view activity logs and ensure that users adhere to the assigned access levels. Any unauthorized attempt is logged for review.
